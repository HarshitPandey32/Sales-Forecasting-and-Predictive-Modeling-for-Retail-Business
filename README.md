# Sales-Forecasting-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Retail-Business
# Overview
This project aims to predict sales for stores in the Rossmann retail chain using historical sales data, store information, and promotional data. The dataset contains sales data for 1,115 stores, including features such as competition, promotions, holidays, and store characteristics. The goal is to build a model that can predict sales for the stores based on various factors that affect sales performance.
# Steps
# 1. Data Import and Merging
The project begins by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The datasets (train.csv, test.csv, and store.csv) are uploaded and merged using the common column Store. This ensures that both training and test data contain relevant information about each store's characteristics.
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Various visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to understand the data, check for missing values, identify outliers, and explore trends. Some of the key steps in the EDA process include:
   * Sales trend analysis over time using line plots.
   * Checking the data distribution using histograms and boxplots.
   * Identifying and handling missing values and outliers using various techniques.
# 3. Data Cleaning
The dataset undergoes extensive cleaning:
   * Handling Missing Values: Null values in multiple columns (e.g., CompetitionDistance, PromoInterval) are filled with appropriate strategies such as mean imputation or mode imputation.
   * Outlier Handling: Outliers are capped using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to avoid data loss.
   * Feature Engineering: The Date column is converted to datetime format, and new features such as Year, Month, Week, and Quarter are extracted.
# 4. Feature Transformation and Encoding
Categorical columns are encoded using Label Encoding, and necessary transformations are applied to continuous variables to make them more suitable for model training. For example:
   * StateHoliday, StoreType, Assortment, and PromoInterval are encoded into numeric values.
   * Feature scaling is applied to some columns like CompetitionDistance, Promo2SinceYear, and Promo2SinceWeek.
# 5. Model Building
The dataset is split into training and test sets. Two models are used to predict sales:
  * Linear Regression: A baseline model to compare performance.
  * XGBoost Regressor: A more advanced model using gradient boosting to improve accuracy.
Both models are evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score.
# 6. Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance is assessed using correlation analysis and mutual information. This helps identify which features are most relevant to predicting sales and provides insight into the model's behavior.
# 7. Residual Error Analysis
Residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are analyzed to check if the model is biased and to ensure that it generalizes well on unseen data.
# 8. Model Deployment
The trained model is saved using joblib, making it ready for future predictions or deployment.
# 9. Predictions
The final step involves making predictions on the test dataset using the trained XGBoost model. The results are saved in a CSV file with predicted sales for each store.
